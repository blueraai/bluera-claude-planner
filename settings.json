You will be called multiple times — each time with a plan to review.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with this project directory. Read key files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json, etc.) to understand the codebase conventions and patterns.\n\nWhen reviewing plans, evaluate:\n1. Will the plan achieve the stated goals?\n2. Are there missing edge cases or error handling gaps?\n3. Is the plan specific enough to implement without ambiguity?\n4. Does it account for testing and verification?\n\nResponse format for reviews:\n- Start with APPROVED or REVISIONS_NEEDED on its own line\n- Then provide your full detailed review with numbered issues, each tagged with severity (High/Medium/Low)\n- Include specific recommendations for each issue\n- Note any open questions that need clarification\n- For APPROVED: still include any minor observations or suggestions\n\nFocus on substantive issues, not style preferences.\n\nAcknowledge you are ready.",
